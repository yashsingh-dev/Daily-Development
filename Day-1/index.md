# Day 1: Daily Learning Tracker

**Date:** December 31, 2025

## 📚 Topics Covered Today

1.  **[Race Conditions in Data Fetching](./Race-condition.md)**
    *   Learn how async requests can overwrite each other and cause stale data bugs.
    *   Solution: Using `AbortController` cleanup function.

2.  **[Axios Cancellation & AbortController Internals](./Axios-AbortController.md)**
    *   How to cancel requests in Axios (replacing deprecated `CancelToken`).
    *   Deep dive into how `AbortController` works under the hood (Event Emitter pattern).

3.  List and Keys in React
    *   Learn why keys are important in List for better optimisation from react side.

4.  **Concurrency vs Parallelism vs Multithreading vs Multiprocessing**
    *   **Concurrency:** Handling multiple tasks at once by rapidly switching between them (like React handling a click while rendering).
    *   **Parallelism:** Executing multiple tasks at the exact same instant using different CPU cores (e.g., Web Workers).
    *   **Multithreading:** Multiple threads within the same process sharing the same memory (fast communication, but a crash kills all threads).
    *   **Multiprocessing:** Multiple independent processes with separate memory (slower communication, but one crash doesn't affect others).


5.  **[Async JS, Promises & Event Loop](./Event-Loop-Async.md)**
    *   **Call Stack vs Microtasks vs Macrotasks.** (Microtasks always win!)
    *   **Callbacks vs Promises:** Why Promises are better.
    *   **Inside the Engine:** How `setTimeout` uses Web APIs vs `async/await` uses Microtasks.

6.  **[TanStack Query (React Query)](./Tanstack-Query.md)**
    *   **What is it?** The "missing data-fetching library" for managing Server State.
    *   **Why use it?** Replaces `useEffect` spaghetti + manual loading/error states.
    *   **Key Features:** Caching, Deduping, Auto-refetch on window focus, and Background updates (Stale-While-Revalidate).
